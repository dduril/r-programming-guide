# R Programming

The purpose of this repo is to provide fundamentals for R programming. Located in the _scripts_ folder are excerpts from the Learning R programming book written by Richard Cotton and published by O'Reilly. 

R is easy to install on Linux, MacOS and Windows and most R programmers seem to prefer using the RStudio IDE.

Packages (libraries) can be installed individually or in bundles such as the Hadleyverse or tidyverse.
